      "answer_texts": [
        "As a software engineer starting a new job, some key actions to take in the first few days include familiarizing yourself with the company culture by observing the work environment and getting to know your colleagues. You should also learn the codebase by spending time understanding the existing code, looking for documentation, and trying to grasp the architecture. It is important to communicate openly with your manager and colleagues about any questions or concerns you have, asking for feedback and seeking mentorship. You should set up your development environment and start working on company projects. Initiate contribution to the team's codebase and participate in code reviews. Build relationships with the team by attending social events and engaging in team activities. Review and update any startup document, ensuring it is accurate and relevant. Thoroughly read through code and documentation to understand its quality and set appropriate expectations with your manager."

      "question_text": "How can a computer science graduate student prepare himself in 2â€“3 months for data scientist/machine learning intern interviews? What skill sets are expected, such as cikit-learn, R, Weka, Kaggle, etc.?",
      "answer_texts": [
        "To prepare for data scientist or machine learning intern interviews in 2-3 months, a computer science graduate should focus on several key areas. First, strengthen your academic foundation, especially core programming skills in Python or R. A solid understanding of statistics and linear algebra is also crucial. You should know common machine learning algorithms, including regression, classification, clustering, and recommendation systems. Get familiar with data manipulation tools like pandas, NumPy, and SQL. Practice data modeling using libraries such as scikit-learn or R and learn data visualization with tools like Plotly, Seaborn, or Matplotlib. Gain experience in data wrangling and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) with tools like Apache Spark or Hadoop and have a basic understanding of database knowledge, including SQL and NoSQL. Familiarity with the data science workflow and tools like Git is also important. To further improve, participate in Kaggle and competitive coding to hone your problem-solving skills and build a portfolio with relevant projects. Finally, brush up on specific Python libraries like TensorFlow and Scikit-learn, and remember that strong problem-solving and communication skills are essential."
