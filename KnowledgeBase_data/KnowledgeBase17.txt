      "answer_texts": [
        "A computer science student preparing for placements and walk-in-interviews should follow a structured approach. First, understand job requirements by reviewing descriptions and focusing on core subjects like data structures, algorithms, databases, operating systems, and networking. Develop technical skills in programming languages like Python, Java, or C++, and practice data structures and algorithms on platforms such as LeetCode or HackerRank. Enhance your English, logical, and quantitative abilities, and keep your resume simple with real-life examples. Build a strong portfolio with projects and maintain a GitHub profile to showcase your skills. Prepare for technical interviews by practicing coding problems and understanding system design. For behavioral questions, use the STAR method. Research companies and their culture, and network with alumni and attend career fairs. Cultivate soft skills such as communication and teamwork, and practice explaining your projects. Stay updated with industry trends through continuous learning. Finally, approach the interview with confidence and a positive mindset, managing stress with relaxation techniques."

      "question_text": "What should I do if I graduated from Computer Science and don't have good coding skills?",
      "answer_texts": [
        "If you're a Computer Science graduate without strong coding skills, there are several steps you can take to improve your situation and find success. First, focus on non-technical roles that are a good fit for your background, such as business analyst, business intelligence analyst, or software quality analyst. At the same time, work on becoming a decent programmer by focusing on your fundamental programming abilities. Use coding challenge platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank, and start your own personal projects to showcase your growth. It's crucial to emphasize your soft skills—like problem-solving, communication, and teamwork—on your resume and in interviews. You can also develop a portfolio on platforms like GitHub to showcase your work, even if you're not a master coder. Improve your resume by tailoring it to highlight your transferable skills. To prepare for interviews, brush up on technical interview skills and practice behavioral questions, all while researching the company's culture and recent news. Network with alumni and on platforms like LinkedIn to expand your contacts. Finally, be open to learning, considering training programs to enhance your coding skills or to pursue related fields like data science. It is essential to be honest about your current abilities while demonstrating a strong willingness to learn and grow."
