      "answer_texts": [
        "As a computer science student, the best job to start with depends on your personal interests and strengths. If you're told to look into networks, that could potentially be worth it if you are passionate about network administration and system management. However, the job market evolves, and with the increasing shift towards cloud-based systems, local system administration roles might not offer significant growth opportunities. In the past, there was a high demand for network engineers and router specialists, so if you stay updated with the industry and have a knack for that area, it could be a viable choice. It's always a good idea to consider your long-term career goals and explore different roles to find what suits you best."
