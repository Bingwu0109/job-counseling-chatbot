      "answer_texts": [
        "Whether to spend more time on LinkedIn or Xing for finding a tech job in Germany depends on the specific situation and priorities. LinkedIn has a broader international reach, with a larger English-speaking user base, which can be beneficial for multinational companies or remote positions. It offers diverse job listings, networking opportunities, and valuable features like learning resources and better content. On the other hand, Xing is more well-known in the DACH region (Germany, Austria, and Switzerland) and is better suited for local job opportunities and networking, particularly in tech.To maximize your chances, consider using both platforms strategically. For tech jobs in Germany, Xing is crucial for local connections and finding opportunities, while LinkedIn can provide access to international companies and a broader network. Engage actively on both to create a comprehensive job search strategy."

        "Yes, it is possible to land a good job at a tech company without a LinkedIn account. While LinkedIn can be a valuable platform for networking and finding job opportunities, other methods such as using referrals, job portals (like naukri.com, Monster), company websites, and connecting with people directly through your network can also be effective. Experienced IT professionals may rely on showcasing their skills through online repositories, personal websites, and platforms like StackExchange, as mentioned in the first response. So, it's not a necessity, but having a strong online presence can certainly enhance your job search.",
